# 🔍 Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **supervised machine learning model** that predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. By analyzing various booking attributes such as guest behavior, lead time, and reservation details, the model generates actionable insights. These insights help hotel managers make informed decisions, minimize revenue loss, and enhance operational efficiency — including staff allocation, inventory planning, and pricing strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a predictive model to **classify bookings as canceled or not**
- Identify **key factors** and behavioral patterns that influence cancellations
- Support hotel managers in **proactively managing cancellations**
- Help reduce financial loss and **optimize resource planning**

## 🧠 Key Concepts (ML Pipeline Order)

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
3. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
4. **Supervised Machine Learning**  
5. **Classification Algorithms**  
6. **Model Evaluation (ROC, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Data Handling**: `pandas`, `NumPy`  
  - **Modeling**: `scikit-learn` (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
  - **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Model Deployment**: `Streamlit` – for building an interactive web app that allows real-time booking predictions

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Name**: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle – Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)  
- **Details**:  
  The dataset includes over 30 features from both **city hotels** and **resort hotels**, such as:
  - Booking lead time
  - Customer demographics
  - Special requests
  - Deposit type
  - Stay duration
  - Meal preferences
  - Cancellation status (target variable)

## 📈 Project Outcomes

- A trained and tested **classification model** to predict cancellations
- **Visual data insights** uncovering key trends (e.g., how lead time or customer type affects cancellations)
- **Feature importance rankings** to help hotels prioritize key operational factors
- An **interactive Streamlit app** to test booking scenarios and receive instant cancellation predictions

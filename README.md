# Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. By analyzing booking details, guest behavior, and timing data, the model provides actionable insights to help hotel managers anticipate cancellations and optimize resource planning (e.g., staffing, room availability, revenue management).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict booking cancellations using historical data
- Identify key factors influencing cancellations
- Enable hotels to proactively manage operations and reduce revenue loss

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Classification Modeling**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Visualization**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data handling: `pandas`, `NumPy`
  - Modeling: `scikit-learn`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Deployment**: Streamlit

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: Hotel Booking Demand Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle – Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)  
- **Description**: Contains booking data from a city hotel and a resort hotel, including customer details, booking behavior, lead times, special requests, and more.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

- Trained classification model to predict cancellations
- Visual insights into patterns of cancellations
- Feature importance rankings to guide hotel strategies
- An interactive frontend to input booking details and get predictions
